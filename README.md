DAS B-TEAM

Fantasy chess is a digital turn based board game, akin to chess. Each turn, both players give fixed orders to their figures to either move or attack. After the turn has endes, the battle rages on following these commands. The battlefield is prepared for the next planing phase.
The last team standing will emerge victorious.
