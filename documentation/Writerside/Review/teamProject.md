### 2. Task Management
- Clear division of roles ensured responsibilities were well-defined.
- Agile methodology was followed, with regular updates and check-ins.
- Use of version control (Git) helped keep the project organized and trackable.
- We also used Git's project management features, which allowed for tracking issues, assigning tasks, and reviewing code efficiently.

- Everyone's opinions were heard, and the best solutions were discussed together.
- The team fostered a supportive environment where brainstorming was encouraged.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Experience & Project Familiarity
- For most members, this was their very first project, leading to uncertainty on how to work efficiently in a team.
- Many team members were new to structured project development and had to learn on the go.
- Not everyone had the same level of experience, which sometimes led to differences in how tasks were approached.

### 2. Decision-Making & Task Prioritization
- Since many people had great ideas, it was not always clear how to decide on the best approach.
- Some issues took longer than expected due to underestimating their difficulty.
- Some tasks were dependent on others, leading to delays when reviews or approvals took longer than planned.

### 3. Time Management & Pacing
- The pacing was inconsistent due to exams and other commitments, affecting availability.
- Some members had more time during certain periods but didnâ€™t always have assigned tasks.
- Issues were sometimes left waiting for review because the assigned reviewer had no time.
- Tasks that seemed simple at first ended up requiring more effort than initially expected.
- University obligations made it difficult to predict who had more workload in other subjects, leading to uneven task distribution.
- Some members got sick at critical moments, causing unforeseen delays that were hard to mitigate.

## Suggested Improvements

### 1. Enhance Planning & Scheduling
- Set up a structured timeline with clear deliverables for each sprint.
- Use project management tools (e.g., Jira, Trello) to track progress.
- Introduce stricter adherence to deadlines to improve efficiency.
- Have a backup plan for delayed reviews to ensure consistent workflow.
- Consider flexible scheduling to account for university workload variations.

### 2. Improve Task Allocation
- Ensure that available members always have something meaningful to work on.
- Assign multiple reviewers to critical issues to prevent bottlenecks.
- Improve estimation of task difficulty by discussing complexity before assignment.
- Plan alternative assignments for members waiting on reviews or dependencies.

### 3. Strengthen Team Dynamics
- Conduct more structured discussions to help make decisions faster.
- Organize knowledge-sharing sessions for less experienced team members.
- Maintain an open and collaborative space for creativity while ensuring focus on core goals.
- Encourage better workload transparency, so members know when others are overloaded or unavailable.

## Action Points
- Assign a project manager or team lead to oversee deadlines and workflow.
- Hold weekly check-ins to assess progress and address blockers.
- Implement coding guidelines to maintain consistency.
- Utilize automated tools to enforce coding standards.
- Improve task delegation so that all members have work distributed more evenly.
- Establish contingency plans for unexpected absences or delays.

### Conclusion
Overall, the team performed well in terms of communication, collaboration, and technical execution. The leadership ensured that the team remained motivated and stress-free while aiming for the deadline. Creativity was a central pillar of the project, and everyone had the opportunity to contribute ideas. With better planning, structured workload distribution, and improved time management, future projects can be executed even more efficiently, even when facing external challenges such as university workload and unexpected absences.
