# Characters

Characters are the core entities in *Fantasy-Chess*, representing the playable u
nits on the battlefield. 
Each character has unique attributes, movement patterns, and attack abilities that define their role in the game.

Characters belong to either of the following categories: *Tank, Ranger, Assassin, Warrior, AoE/Mage/Bomber* and *Suicide Bomber*

Their actions, such as moving, attacking, or defending, influence the outcome of the match.
The game logic ensures that each character follows predefined rules based on their stats, position, and available commands.

<!-- This documentation provides an overview of:
- **Character attributes** (health, attack power, movement range, etc.).
- **Character behavior and interactions** within the game.
- **How characters are created, managed, and displayed** in the game world.
