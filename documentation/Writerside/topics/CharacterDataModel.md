# Character Data Model

`Author: Albano Vukelaj`

It defines all static properties such as attack and movement patterns, base stats, and descriptions.
Unlike [](CharacterEntity.md), which changes dynamically during the game,
`CharacterDataModel` remains constant and serves as a template for creating new character entities.

### Structure of CharacterDataModel
