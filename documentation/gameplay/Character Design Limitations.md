# Guidelines and Limitations for Character Design

## Stats

Characters should follow the principal of the statistics triangle:

- Movement
- Attack
- Health

They should be balanced and if one Character breaks from this norm, all other Stats should
go down and reflect the spike in a certain direction.

Maximum health: 50
Minimum health: 5

Maximum Damage: 25
Minimum Damage: 1

Maximum Damage Distance: 6 Tiles

Max Area of affect Radius: 5x5

Max Displacement from current position: 6 Tiles
Minimum Movement: 0

## Visual

Character Sprites should be 32px wide and 32px tall.
When using the full size of the sprite, ensure not to fully
obstruct the Character above.
